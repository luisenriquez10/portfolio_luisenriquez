          <li><strong>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean? </strong></li>
					<p> I think that some of the most improtant vocabulary terms and key concepts learned in this unit was html, tags,closing tags, opening tags,headers(ex h1,h2,h3),lists,and unordered lists. </p>

          <li><strong>What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study? </strong></li>
					<p>I think that some of the most important skills in this unit of study is the ability to create lists and the ability to properly size my headers to show the difference in importance of one title or header to another. </p>

          <li><strong>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work? </strong></li>
					<p>I've gotten better at knowing some of the HTML basics and basic knowledge over the Html language. </p>

          <li><strong>In what ways do you think you need to improve? </strong></li>
					<p>I feel as if I need to improve on knowing more about links and working with links because it is something that I think I struggle a little bit with. </p>

          <li><strong>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve this? </strong></li>
					<p>When working with my portfolio and this piece some of my problems were that the code academy is very time consuming and it's difficult to work on this piece because often times I am not home which means I do not have access to my person computer. </p>

          <li><strong>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product? </strong></li>
					<p>It was satisfying to make my web portfolio and to learn about html because I am a person who loves technology and everything that revolves around it so when I began learning HTML it was satisfying to me. </p>

          <li><strong>If you where a teacher, what comments would you make about this piece? </strong></li>
					<p>I'd say that for a begginer and someone who's never worked with the HTML code this piece is satisfactory and decent. </p>

				<p>Some of the most important vocabulary terms that I learned in this lesson are CSS, styles, curly baces, hexadecimal value, and color. Most of these terms have to do with CSS (meaning cascading style sheets), words such as styles and hexadecimal value in css have to do with the color or font in css and is used only in CSS, not html.</p>

				<p>I've gotten better linking parts of my files/folders to other parts of my portfolio and have also gotten better at using color withing my portfolio.</p>

				<p>I need to slightly improve my work pace</p>

				<li><strong>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?</strong></li>
				<p>I had difficulty linking my stylesheet.css file from my index.html, other than that, there wasn't any problems involving this unit.</p>

				<li><strong>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?</strong></li>
				<p>I was highly satisfied after creating a color scheme/theme that I felt was pleasing to the eyes and looks good</p>

				<li><strong>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece?</strong></li>
				<p>I would say that the color and font that were applied to the webpage look appealing. I would also say the work is satisfactory</p>
